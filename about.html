<h2> All about me! </h2>

<p>I recently graduated from Northwestern University's undergraduate program and am now an Acceletarted Master's Candidate in the Medill School of Journalism Graduate Program. I'm specializing in Video and Broadcast Journalism. My anticipated graduation is in August 2025. </p>

<h3> Class of '25 by the numbers: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Northwestern's class of 2025 had a 7% acceptance rate.</li>
  <li>About 1/2 of Northwestern students were admitted through early decision.</li>
  <li>Over 20% of the class of '25 indicated two or more races/ethnicities.</li>
</ul>

<p> Outside of Journalism, I have a deep passion for health and fitness. I regularly train 1-1 clients in personal training and teach group exercise classes for Northwestern Recreation and Life Time. </p>

<p> Post-grad, I am looking to stay in Chicago and am targeting careers in sales and marketing. I intend to take a gap year working in Tokyo before juming into full-time employment in the United States.</p>

<p> I have a younger brother who looks exactly like me, a father who's extremely talented at trivia, and a mother who's a great cook. As a family, we love nature and wildlife. We also have one cat named Goodcat. </p>
