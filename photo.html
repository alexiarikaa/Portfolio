<p> I’ve developed a deep passion for traveling the world and using my journalistic skills to capture the beauty of each location. 2024 was my strongest travel year, taking 46 flights spanning over 30 new cities. </p>

<h3> Where it all started:</h3>
<p> In the spring of 2023, I met an international student from Australia in one of my classes. As we talked about her home country, I was struck by how much I wanted to visit Australia myself. I decided that winter break that year would be the perfect time to travel there. I travel often, but I always prefer to have company—it takes some of the planning stress away. I knew I wanted to go for 4 weeks, so I asked my mom to join me for 2 weeks, and my cousin to join for the other 2. However, as time went on and the travel plans started to solidify, both my mom and cousin decided not to come because travel costs in December were too high. As a student, December was my only extended break, and time was my currency. I knew I had to go, even if I had to go alone. </p>
<p>So I did. </p>
<p>Having never been to Australia before, with no knowledge of the country, no travel plans in place, and no one to accompany me, I took off. I decided to figure things out as I went along. When I first arrived in Sydney, I remember thinking, "Uhhh, now what?" I was really on my own! My first move was to book a party hostel for my first few nights. It didn’t take long to realize that almost everyone there was in the same boat: young, solo, and ready to explore and meet new people. I asked fellow travelers for recommendations and their favorite spots, and before long, I had a rough itinerary for my trip. Staying flexible, I booked my next few days as I went along. Because I was on my own, I could do whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it—no compromises. The freedom was incredible. </p>
<p>Although I hadn’t planned much in advance, I knew there were four things I absolutely wanted to do during my 4 weeks in Australia: surf, snorkel, scuba dive, and skydive.</p>
<p>So I did. </p>
<p>I swapped a nice hostel for a shack on the beach, where I spent a week taking surf lessons for four hours each day. I made huge progress in a sport I’d never tried before, eventually catching a green wave on my own. I lived aboard a boat for three days as I toured the Whitsunday Islands, snorkeling at 8 distinct reef locations, and swimming with turtles, stingrays, and even baby sharks. I dove 10 meters to the sea floor in the Great Barrier Reef for my very first scuba dive, interacting with giant clams and sea cucumbers. On Christmas Eve, I experienced an exhilarating skydive from 14,000 feet above the Great Barrier Reef. </p>
<p>To top off my incredible adventure, I spent New Year's Eve watching the fireworks explode over Sydney's Harbor Bridge, bringing my solo journey along the east coast of Australia full circle. By the end of my trip, I was so grateful that I chose to go alone. The absence of consistent companionship pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to talk to new people and make friends wherever I went. With no one else to rely on, my independence and self-confidence soared. Most importantly, seeing some of the world’s most stunning natural wonders in Australia made me realize just how much more there is to see. I understood that I could only experience these things if I went out and pursued every travel opportunity that came my way. </p>
<p>Flying solo to Australia was the best decision I made in 2023. If you've never traveled alone before, I encourage you to plan a trip for yourself this year. You never know what you're missing out on, until you can go and say, “So I did.” </p>
